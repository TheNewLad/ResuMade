# ResuMake
## Overview
This project draws inspiration from Resumake.io. I loved the idea of creating a resume using JSON as it's plaintext and that allows me to keep the history of changes of my resume in git. The reason I'm making my own version is that I felt Resumake didn't have all the sections I wanted. This project will use the JSONResume schema to be more in line with a great resume base.
